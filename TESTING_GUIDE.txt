SUBMISSION TESTING GUIDE
================================================================================

STEP 1: Test the submission form
---------------------------------
1. Login as manager (manager@mysite.com / Password!234)
2. Go to Submit Expenses page
3. Open Browser Console (F12 → Console tab)
4. Fill the form:
   - Select an outlet
   - Enter income values (all fields)
   - Click "+ Add MP/BERHAD Expense"
   - Fill category, amount, upload a receipt image/PDF
   - Click "Submit Daily Report"

STEP 2: Check console for errors
---------------------------------
In the browser console, you should see:
✅ "Form submit triggered"
✅ "MP expenses: 1 Market expenses: 0"
✅ "Form submitting..."

If you see errors, copy and paste them.

STEP 3: Check for error messages
---------------------------------
After clicking submit, check:
- Does the loading overlay appear?
- Does it redirect to history page?
- OR does it show an error message?

STEP 4: Common Issues & Fixes
-------------------------------
❌ "Please add at least one expense"
   → You must add at least 1 MP/BERHAD or Market expense

❌ "Receipt/voucher is required"
   → Make sure you upload a file for each expense

❌ "Failed to create upload directory"
   → Run: mkdir C:\xampp\htdocs\my_site\uploads\receipts

❌ "Upload directory is not writable"
   → Check folder permissions

❌ "Invalid file type"
   → Only JPG, PNG, PDF allowed

❌ "File size exceeds 5MB"
   → Reduce file size

STEP 5: Verify in database
---------------------------
After successful submission, check phpMyAdmin:
- Table: daily_submissions → Should have 1 new row
- Table: expenses → Should have your expense rows
- Check: uploads/receipts/ folder → Should have uploaded files

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

If submit button does nothing:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check if outlets exist in database (Table: outlets)
3. Check if expense categories exist (Table: expense_categories)

If you get database errors:
1. Make sure you imported all SQL files:
   - 001_create_users.sql
   - 010_seed_initial_users.sql
   - 002_create_manager_tables.sql
   - 020_seed_outlets_categories.sql

If file upload fails:
1. Create folder: C:\xampp\htdocs\my_site\uploads\receipts
2. Give full permissions to the folder
