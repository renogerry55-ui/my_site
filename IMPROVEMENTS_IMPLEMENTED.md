# Improvements Implemented

## ‚úÖ 1. Duplicate Submission Validation (UI Level)

**Problem:** Managers could accidentally try to create duplicate submissions for the same outlet and date, which would fail at the database level with a confusing error.

**Solution:** Added real-time validation using AJAX that checks for duplicates when the manager selects an outlet and date.

### How it works:
- When manager changes the **Outlet** or **Date** field, JavaScript makes an AJAX call
- PHP endpoint (`includes/check_duplicate_submission.php`) checks the database
- If duplicate exists:
  - **Status: DRAFT** ‚Üí Shows warning with link to edit the existing draft
  - **Status: PENDING/VERIFIED/etc** ‚Üí Shows warning that submission already exists (cannot create duplicate)

### Files Modified:
1. **includes/check_duplicate_submission.php** (NEW)
   - AJAX endpoint to check for duplicate submissions

2. **views/manager/submit_expenses.php**
   - Added warning div at line 573
   - Added `checkDuplicateSubmission()` JavaScript function at line 857
   - Event listeners added at lines 913-918

### User Experience:
- **Before:** Manager fills out entire form ‚Üí Submits ‚Üí Gets error "A submission for this outlet and date already exists"
- **After:** Manager selects outlet and date ‚Üí Immediately sees warning "A submission already exists as DRAFT. [Click here to edit it]"

## ‚úÖ 2. Edit Draft Submissions (FULLY COMPLETED)

**Problem:** Once a submission is created as DRAFT, manager cannot edit it. They would have to delete and recreate.

**Solution:** Full inline editing form for DRAFT submissions with ability to modify all data and keep/replace receipts.

### Implementation:
1. ‚úÖ Added "Edit" button next to DRAFT submissions in view_history.php (line 370-373)
2. ‚úÖ Created complete `edit_submission.php` page with:
   - Full form pre-filled with existing data
   - Edit all income fields (berhad, mp_coba, mp_perdana, market)
   - Edit all expense fields (category, amount, description)
   - Add new expenses
   - Remove expenses
   - Keep existing receipt OR upload new receipt
   - Edit notes
   - Real-time totals calculation
   - Permission validation (only owner, only DRAFT)

3. ‚úÖ Created `update_submission.php` handler that:
   - Validates submission ownership and status
   - Updates income values
   - Deletes old expenses
   - Inserts new/modified expenses
   - Handles file uploads (new files)
   - Keeps existing files (if not replaced)
   - Recalculates totals
   - Transaction-safe updates

### Status:
- ‚úÖ Duplicate validation: **COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ Edit page (full editing): **COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ Edit button in history: **COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ Update handler: **COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ File replacement logic: **COMPLETED**

### Files Created/Modified:
1. **views/manager/view_history.php** (line 370-373)
   - Added yellow "‚úèÔ∏è Edit" button for DRAFT submissions
   - Button only appears when status === 'draft'

2. **views/manager/edit_submission.php** (NEW - COMPLETE FORM)
   - Pre-fills all income fields with current values
   - Loads all existing expenses with data
   - JavaScript for adding/removing expenses dynamically
   - Radio buttons to keep or replace receipt files
   - Real-time calculation of totals
   - Form posts to itself for update
   - Orange/yellow theme to distinguish from create form

3. **includes/update_submission.php** (NEW)
   - Validates permission and DRAFT status
   - Updates daily_submissions table
   - Deletes old expenses
   - Inserts updated expenses
   - Handles receipt file logic (keep existing OR upload new)
   - Transaction-safe with rollback on error

### How It Works:
1. Manager clicks yellow "‚úèÔ∏è Edit" button on DRAFT submission
2. Form loads with all current data pre-filled
3. Manager can:
   - Change any income amounts
   - Modify expense categories, amounts, descriptions
   - Keep existing receipt or upload new one (radio button choice)
   - Add more expenses
   - Remove expenses
   - Update notes
4. Click "üíæ Update Submission"
5. System validates and saves all changes
6. Success message shown with updated totals

## Current Workflow Status:

```
DRAFT ‚Üí PENDING ‚Üí VERIFIED/REJECTED
  ‚Üë        ‚Üë
  |        |
 Edit   (locked, no edit)
```

### Statuses:
- **DRAFT:** "Pending to Send to HQ" - Manager can EDIT ‚úÖ
- **PENDING:** "Pending Account Approval" - Locked, cannot edit ‚ùå
- **VERIFIED:** "Approved" - Locked, cannot edit ‚ùå
- **REJECTED:** "Rejected" - Locked, cannot edit ‚ùå

## Testing Notes:

### To Test Duplicate Validation:
1. Go to submit_expenses.php
2. Select an outlet (e.g., Outlet A)
3. Select today's date
4. If a submission already exists, you'll see a yellow warning box
5. If status is DRAFT, you'll see a link to edit it

### Next Steps:
- Create edit_submission.php page
- Add Edit button in view_history.php for DRAFT submissions
- Test complete edit workflow
