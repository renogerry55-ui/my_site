# PROJECT DIARY - Daily Sales & Expense Management System

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025
**Current Branch:** `codex/add-manager-pending-card-for-clarity-tv18os`
**Database Schema:** `database/br (4).sql`

---

## üìã PROJECT OVERVIEW

This is a **multi-outlet daily sales and expense reporting system** designed for a business operating multiple sales channels. The system manages the complete workflow from outlet closing reports to accountant verification and finance approval.

### Business Context
- The company operates multiple outlets
- Each outlet generates income from 4 different streams:
  1. **Berhad Sales** (external system agent ID)
  2. **MP Coba Sales** (external system login ID)
  3. **MP Perdana Sales** (external system login ID)
  4. **Market Sales**
- Managers submit daily closing reports with expenses
- Accountants verify submissions against external system data
- Finance department provides final approval

---

## üîÑ WORKFLOW PROCESS

### Phase 1: Manager Submission
```
Manager ‚Üí Select Outlet ‚Üí Enter Income (4 streams) ‚Üí Add Expenses with Receipts ‚Üí Submit
```

1. Manager selects outlet and submission date
2. Enters income for all 4 streams:
   - Berhad Sales
   - MP Coba Sales
   - MP Perdana Sales
   - Market Sales
3. Adds expenses (MP/Berhad or Market category)
4. Each expense requires:
   - Category selection
   - Amount
   - Description (optional)
   - Receipt/voucher upload (mandatory)
5. System calculates: `Net Amount = Total Income - Total Expenses`
6. Can create multiple submissions (one per outlet/date)
7. Status: `draft` (saved but not submitted)

### Phase 2: Batch Submission to HQ
```
Manager ‚Üí submit_to_hq.php ‚Üí Select draft submissions ‚Üí Batch submit ‚Üí Status: pending
```

1. Manager reviews all draft submissions
2. Can submit multiple outlets together as a batch
3. For each submission, manager decides:
   - **Amount to HQ:** Cash to send to headquarters
   - **Cash Kept:** Cash manager retains (calculated automatically)
   - **Variance Reason:** Required if amount_to_hq ‚â† net_amount
4. System creates batch code for tracking
5. All submissions in batch get status: `pending`
6. Manager's cash on hand balance is updated

### Phase 3: Accountant Verification
```
Accountant ‚Üí verify_submission.php ‚Üí Select income stream ‚Üí Upload external data ‚Üí Compare ‚Üí Save & Verify
```

**Overview Page (`verify_submission.php`):**
- Shows all pending submissions grouped by manager
- Displays summary cards for each manager with:
  - Total income by stream
  - Total expenses (MP/Berhad vs Market)
  - Number of outlets and submissions
- Quick links to verify each income stream

**Income Stream Verification (e.g., `berhad_sales_verification.php`):**
1. Accountant pastes external sales data from external portal
2. System automatically parses the data (supports tab/comma/semicolon delimited)
3. Real-time preview shows parsed data in structured table
4. Click "Compare Data" button:
   - System matches outlets by their external agent/login IDs
   - Compares both sales AND expenses (claimed amounts)
   - Shows match/mismatch/not found status for each outlet
5. If all outlets match (sales + expenses match exactly):
   - "Save & Verify" button enabled
   - Data saved to `berhad_external_sales_data` table
   - Accountant can proceed to approval
6. If mismatches found:
   - Shows detailed comparison for each outlet
   - Accountant must resolve discrepancies
   - Can send back to manager for correction

**External Sales Data Format:**
```
Agent ID    Name         Level    Deposit Count    Total Deposit    Withdraw Count    Total Withdraw    Total
pasar888    outlet A     Agent    515              1000             175               0                 10782.60
senadin8    outlet B     Agent    68               2000             13                0                 259
```

- **Total Deposit** = Sales amount (compared against submitted sales)
- **Total Withdraw** = Expenses claimed (compared against BERHAD/MP expenses)

### Phase 4: Finance Approval
```
Finance ‚Üí Review verified submissions ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Status: approved
```

## üöÄ RECENT WORK & CURRENT FOCUS

### Latest Commits (as of Oct 15, 2025)

1. **4da1aad** - Latest db scheme
2. **f3ce600** - Add automated comparison gating for Berhad external sales
3. **cfee692** - Fix external sales template header count

### Current Branch: `codex/add-manager-pending-card-for-clarity-tv18os`
**Work in Progress:**
- Adding manager pending card for better visibility
- Improving clarity in the accountant's verification workflow

### Recent Features Added

#### 1. **Automated Comparison Gating (Oct 2025)**
**File:** `views/account/berhad_sales_verification.php`

**What was added:**
- Accountant uploads external sales data once per manager
- System automatically compares ALL outlets for that manager
- Compares both:
  - **Sales**: Berhad Sales (submitted) vs Total Deposit (external)
  - **Expenses**: Berhad Claimed (submitted) vs Total Withdraw (external)
- Visual feedback:
  - ‚úì Match (green) - Both sales AND expenses match
  - ‚úó Mismatch (red) - Sales or expenses don't match
  - ‚ö† Not Found (orange) - Outlet's agent ID not in external data
- **Gating logic**: Save button only enabled if ALL outlets match
- Shows detailed comparison breakdown for each outlet
- Real-time preview as accountant pastes data

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents data entry errors
- Ensures external data matches before accountant can proceed
- Saves time by verifying all outlets at once
- Reduces manual comparison errors

#### 2. **External Sales Template Tables**
- Added visual template tables showing expected data format
- Real-time preview populates as data is pasted
- Helps accountants understand data structure
- Supports multiple delimiters (tab, comma, semicolon)

#### 3. **Manager Cash Management**
- Added `manager_cash_on_hand` table
- Tracks cumulative cash balance
- Updated in `submit_to_hq.php` when batch submitted
- Shows managers their current cash balance

---

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES & TODO

### Outstanding Work

1. **MP Perdana Verification Workflow**
   - Files exist but workflow incomplete
   - Need to implement similar comparison logic to Berhad

2. **Market Sales Verification**
   - Currently marked as "Coming Soon"
   - No external system to compare against yet
   - Workflow design pending

3. **Finance Approval Workflow**
   - Finance role defined but dashboard minimal
   - Need finance-specific verification pages
   - Need finance approval action pages

4. **Expense Categorization by Accountant**
   - Database fields exist (`is_categorized`, `categorized_by`)
   - UI not implemented yet
   - Currently expenses go directly to categories chosen by manager

5. **Manager Cash Balance UI**
   - Backend tracking works
   - Need to show cash balance in manager dashboard
   - Need cash history/ledger view

### Current Branch Tasks

**Branch:** `codex/add-manager-pending-card-for-clarity-tv18os`

Tasks likely in scope:
- [ ] Add visual card showing pending count for managers
- [ ] Improve clarity in verify_submission.php display
- [ ] Better visual hierarchy for income stream cards
- [ ] Possibly add filters/search to pending submissions

## üéØ UNDERSTANDING THE BUSINESS FLOW

### Real-World Example

**Scenario:** Manager closes Outlet A for October 14, 2025

1. **End of Day - Manager Records:**
   - Berhad Sales: RM 10,000
   - MP Coba Sales: RM 5,000
   - MP Perdana Sales: RM 3,000
   - Market Sales: RM 2,000
   - **Total Income:** RM 20,000

   - Staff Salary: RM 2,000
   - Rent: RM 1,500
   - Utilities: RM 500
   - Berhad Claimed (player withdrawals): RM 8,000
   - **Total Expenses:** RM 12,000

   - **Net Amount:** RM 8,000

2. **Cash Decision - Manager:**
   - Net is RM 8,000
   - Manager decides to send RM 5,000 to HQ
   - Keep RM 3,000 cash on hand
   - Variance reason: "Need petty cash for next week operations"

3. **Verification - Accountant:**
   - Logs into external Berhad portal
   - Exports data showing:
     - Agent: pasar888 (Outlet A)
     - Total Deposit: RM 10,000 ‚úì matches submitted sales
     - Total Withdraw: RM 8,000 ‚úì matches claimed expenses
   - Pastes into verification page
   - System shows: ‚úì Match - All good!
   - Accountant clicks "Save & Verify"

4. **Approval - Finance:**
   - Reviews verified submission
   - Sees all data matches external sources
   - Approves submission
   - Manager gets notification
   - RM 5,000 recorded as receivable from manager

5. **Next Submission:**
   - Manager's cash on hand: RM 3,000
   - Can use this for next submission

### Why This System Exists

**Pain Points Solved:**
1. **Manual Comparison Errors**: Used to manually compare Excel sheets from external portals - error-prone
2. **Cash Tracking**: Managers often keep cash, hard to track who has what
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of who approved what and when
4. **Receipt Management**: All receipts digitally stored and linked
5. **Multi-Stream Complexity**: 4 different income streams, each with own external portal
6. **Batch Processing**: Can submit 10 outlets at once instead of one by one

## üí° TIPS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

1. **When Adding New Income Stream Verification:**
   - Copy `berhad_sales_verification.php` as template
   - Create corresponding external_sales_data table
   - Update verification workflow in verify_submission.php
   - Add save handler in includes/account/

2. **When Modifying Comparison Logic:**
   - Main logic in JavaScript within berhad_sales_verification.php (line ~850-1014)
   - Backend validation in save_berhad_external_sales_batch.php
   - Test with mismatched data first
   - Consider tolerance for rounding (currently 0.01)

3. **When Adding New Status:**
   - Update daily_submissions.status enum
   - Update status checks in all verification pages
   - Update workflow display in view_history.php
   - Document new status in this diary

4. **Testing Workflow:**
   - Create test manager submissions
   - Use test data from database
   - Agent IDs: pasar888, senadin8, pasar81
   - Test both matching and mismatching scenarios

#### Technical Implementation Details

**JSON Receipt Storage:**
```php
// In submission_handler.php
$uploadedReceipts = ['receipt1.jpg', 'receipt2.pdf', 'receipt3.png'];
$receiptFilesJson = json_encode($uploadedReceipts);
// Stored in expenses.receipt_file column

// In expenses_verification.php
$receiptFiles = json_decode($expense['receipt_file'], true) ?? [];
// Parsed back to array for display
```

**File Upload Handling:**
```php
// Multiple file upload loop
for ($i = 0; $i < $fileCount; $i++) {
    $uploadResult = handleReceiptUpload(
        $filesData['expense_receipts']['name'][$i],
        $filesData['expense_receipts']['tmp_name'][$i],
        $filesData['expense_receipts']['size'][$i],
        $filesData['expense_receipts']['error'][$i],
        $submissionCode
    );
    $uploadedReceipts[] = $uploadResult['filename'];
}
```

**Uncategorized Expense Query:**
```sql
UPDATE expenses e
INNER JOIN expense_categories ec ON e.expense_category_id = ec.id
SET e.approval_status = 'approved',
    e.approved_by = :account_id,
    e.approved_at = NOW()
WHERE e.submission_id = :submission_id
  AND UPPER(ec.category_name) = 'UNCATEGORIZED'
```

#### User Impact

**Manager Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Faster submission process (no category selection needed)
- ‚úÖ Simpler form with less fields
- ‚úÖ Can upload multiple receipts at once
- ‚úÖ Less room for categorization errors

**Accountant Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Dedicated page for expense review
- ‚úÖ Visual receipt preview (no need to download)
- ‚úÖ Can approve/reject with clear feedback
- ‚úÖ Rejection reason captured for audit trail
- ‚úÖ All manager's expenses in one view

#### Workflow Changes

**OLD FLOW:**
```
Manager submits ‚Üí Selects category ‚Üí Accountant verifies sales only
```

**NEW FLOW:**
```
Manager submits ‚Üí No category selected ‚Üí Accountant:
  1. Verifies sales (existing workflow)
  2. Reviews expenses ‚Üí Preview receipts ‚Üí Approve or Reject
  3. If rejected ‚Üí Submission goes back to manager (status: resubmit)
```

#### Database Status Flow

```
Expense Approval:
  pending ‚Üí approved (via approve_expenses.php)
  pending ‚Üí rejected (via reject_expenses.php)

Submission Status:
  pending ‚Üí resubmit (when expenses rejected)
  - Updates returned_to_manager_at timestamp
  - Adds accountant_notes with rejection details
```

#### Why "Save & Verify" Disabled

Per user request: The "Save & Verify" button on sales verification pages has been temporarily disabled. This will be re-enabled in a future update once the complete verification workflow is finalized. The comparison functionality still works - accountants can compare data, but cannot save/verify at this time.

**Files Affected:**
- berhad_sales_verification.php
- mp_coba_sales_verification.php
- mp_perdana_sales_verification.php

All buttons and event listeners are commented out (not deleted) for easy re-enablement.

#### Testing Notes

To test the new workflow:

1. **Manager Side:**
   ```
   Login: manager / password
   Go to: submit_expenses.php
   - Enter outlet, date, income streams
   - Enter total expenses amount (e.g., RM 1500)
   - Upload multiple receipts (jpg/png/pdf)
   - Submit
   - Go to submit_to_hq.php and batch submit
   ```

2. **Accountant Side:**
   ```
   Login: accountant / password
   Go to: verify_submission.php
   - Look for "Expenses Review" card (orange)
   - Click to go to expenses_verification.php
   - View receipts (images preview, PDFs show icon)
   - Click Approve or Request Resubmit
   ```

3. **Expected Results:**
   - Approve: Expense status ‚Üí approved
   - Reject: Submission status ‚Üí resubmit, manager notified via accountant_notes

#### Known Considerations

1. **Receipt File Types:** Currently supports JPG, PNG, PDF (validated in handleReceiptUpload)
2. **File Size Limit:** 5MB per file (defined in config)
3. **Storage:** All receipts stored in `/uploads/receipts/`
4. **JSON Storage:** Using JSON to store multiple filenames in single database column
5. **Category ID:** Hardcoded to look for "UNCATEGORIZED" (should be ID 20 per schema)

#### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for next iteration:
- [ ] Bulk approve/reject for multiple submissions
- [ ] Add expense categorization UI for accountant
- [ ] Filter expenses by date range
- [ ] Search functionality for receipts
- [ ] Thumbnail generation for large images
- [ ] PDF preview inline (using PDF.js or similar)
- [ ] Re-enable Save & Verify with proper workflow integration
- [ ] Add notifications to manager when expenses rejected
